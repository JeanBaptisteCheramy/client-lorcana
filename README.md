This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# About me
Welcome to my Github.

https://github.com/JeanBaptisteCheramy

This is a project I am working on to explore NextJS. I am self-learning by conducting research on the internet. I work using the documentation and all possible resources to enhance my skills on a daily basis.

If you are a recruiter, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I am always optimistic about engaging in discussions and open to new opportunities.

# client-lorcana

This is a Front-end project for the trading card game Lorcana, built in React.js using the Nextjs framework (TypeScript). The idea is for users to create their own collection and build decks with it. Backend in there: https://github.com/JeanBaptisteCheramy/lorcana-back

It's a work in progress.




## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
